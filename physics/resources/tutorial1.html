  <h3>Make a Tutorial</h3>
  
  Teacher  Peter Tsun <br/>
  School
          Newtown High School <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Brief</strong><br/>
<br/>
<p>
Write a web page that explains one of the following concepts:
Conversion, scientific notation and operations on numbers in scientific notation, draw vectors, or adding and subtracting vectors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Requirements:</b><br/>
<br/>
Your tutorial must:<br/>
<br/>
- be written in html and css and possibly Javascript.<br/>
- have a written explanation (text) that explains the concepts.<br/>
- have pictures or illustrations that help the readers learn the concepts.<br/>
- provide several examples that illustrate how the concepts can be applied to some common problems.<br/>
- include relevant videos that explain the concepts in a clear and concise manner. (maybe a Music video)<br/>
- provides a way for a reader to leave behind comments and feedback on your page.<br/>
</p>

<b>Presentation:</b>
<br/>
<br/>
You will read another person’s web page that teaches a concept other than the one you chose for your project.  You will have 8 minutes to explain the concepts based on what you learned from the other student’s web page. In your presentation, be sure to teach the big ideas in a clear and succinct way and to show how the concepts are applied to solve common problems. If time permits, conclude the presentation with a video or a song about the concept you are presenting.

Subject: "The Internet built my daughter an app" by Dale Basler, physics teacher in Wisconsin

[Dale Basler, a physics teacher in Wisconsin, took a Modeling
Workshop, long ago.  Today I came across this blogpost by him, that
warms my heart. What a gift he gave to his daughter! -- Jane J]

The Internet built my daughter an app
    October 5th, 2014

In May, my nine-year-old daughter suffered a stroke. The stroke
weakened the left side of her body severely. However, with therapy
she has managed to improve each week. Because of the stroke, she has
a lot of tone in her arm. This causes her arm to pull up close to her
body instead of naturally resting down and at her side. She has to
make a conscience effort to put her arm down and we are frequently
reminding her.

One day I got an idea. Could we use sensors to measure when her arm
is up and use a vibration to remind her to put her arm down? After a
little digging online, I quickly learned that the Pebble smartwatch
has an accelerometer that could be used to detect orientation.

As a physics teacher, I understand accelerometers and I have a little
bit of programing experience but I had zero experience with the
Pebble watch. So I reached out to the community of Pebble enthusiasts
and developers in the Pebble Forums. I explained my situation and
asked if my idea was even possible.

What happened next was truly remarkable. Within a day, I had a
response explaining that my idea was possible. By the next day,
another user made me a working prototype app. I learned how to
install the app on a Pebble watch that my good friend loaned me. I
made adjustments to the code using an online development tool ...

Another user offered to merge the app into a watch face "so the watch
doesn't have to look like it's only there for the stroke." From here,
things really took off. With my feedback, we added several other
features such as a learning mode  ...

This experience has shown my daughter the true power of the Internet.
She saw that it is so much more than a place to consume media. The
Internet allows total strangers from all over the world to work
together. She learned that people will volunteer their time and skill
to create new things and help others.

It is the best lesson about the Internet I could ever hope for her to learn.
