  </div>
    <p>I always want to learn Chinese, but I find that formal instruction
       is not for me - at least for now. The instructors of Chinese language want to teach more contents
       to me than I am willing and able to handle. Also, teachers of Chinese language may not be
       available to teach me when I am free. In addition, I am slow when it comes to learning
       a new language, so I would keep asking the same question repeatedly. My repeated questions
       would wear out even the most patient teacher. I found that replaying the chinese words
       on Google translate allows me to learn a few words a day. With the information available here, you can
       look up the words in Chinese and learn how to pronouce it with Google translate whenever you want to.
    </p> 

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 class="attentionRed"><a href="components.html">Components 字 - character</a></h3>
      <p>Chinese words can be one character and sometimes two characters. Like the components
         that make up a personal computer, the Chinese words are put together in various ways
         to convey meaning and information. Before one can makes a sensible sentence, one needs
         to learn the words or the components of a sentence. Here, you will learn the pin yin
         of different Chinese words. After you learn individual words, you will be able to put
         them together to make sentences that Chinese speakers can understand.
      </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 class="attentionRed"><a href="assembling.html">Assembling 句子 - sentence</a></h3>
      <p>In this section, there will be various prompts that will guide you with leading
         questions to pronounce the words in Chinese. You will be asked how to pronounce
         individual words, as well as putting words together and saying your own sentence
         in Chinese.

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 class="attentionRed"><a href="resultants.html">Resultants 成語 - idiom</a></h3>        
      <p>Here you will find memorable phrases and frequently used words that hopefully will
         serve you well. This is a place where you will find a collection of handy Chinese
         sayings and expressions. When you study Chinese, you can focus on the pronunciation, or
         you can focus on the written Chinese, or you can do both. It is up to you. However, 
         you will notice the benefits of knowing how
         to speak Chinese sooner.
